Part studio, part band, part community, Organic Gold is a post punk project produced by two musicians, Jonny Cole and Julie Milton. Primarily influenced by their love of punk rock and synth pop, OG draws its inspiration from artists like New Order, The Faint, Gary Numan, At the Drive-In, DEVO, Refused, The Knife, Depeche Mode, and related avant garde artists who cross lines and blend sounds.
